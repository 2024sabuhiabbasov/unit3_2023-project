# Unit 3: Ski/snowboard rental shop tracker app

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
<p align="justify">
Oswell Taiga Sakaguchi runs a ski and snowboard rental shop called "Fly skis" in Karuizawa. They offer skis, snowboards, shoes, and clothes for rent to customers. Many people from Japan and other countries visit Karuizawa for skiing or snowboarding and choose Fly skis because it is known for having the best equipment. This has been great for Mr. Sakaguchi's business, but it has also created problems for his employees. They have recently expressed their frustration to Mr. Sakaguchi about the lack of a system to keep track of the equipment that has been rented out. This makes it hard for them to help customers when they return the equipment, as they need to search for the receipt and confirm that all items have been returned. Some workers have even threatened to quit if the situation is not resolved.

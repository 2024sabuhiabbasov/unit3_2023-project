# Unit 3: Ski/snowboard rental shop tracker

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
<p align="justify">
Oswell Taiga Sakaguchi runs a ski and snowboard rental shop called "Fly Skis" in Karuizawa. They offer skis, snowboards, shoes, and clothes for rent to customers visiting the area for skiing or snowboarding. Fly Skis is known for having the best equipment, which has been great for Mr. Sakaguchi's business.
However, this has also created problems for his employees. They have recently expressed their frustration about the lack of a system to keep track of the equipment that has been rented out. This makes it difficult for them to help customers when they return the equipment, as they need to search for the receipt and confirm that all items have been returned. Some workers have even threatened to quit if the situation is not resolved.

## Proposed Solution
### Design Statement
<p align="justify">
To solve the issue of keeping track of equipment rented out at Fly Skis, a custom application can be developed using the Python programming language and the Kivy MD library for the user interface design. The choice of Python was made for several reasons, including its ease of use, large community, and wide range of libraries. It is also available on all software systems. The Kivy MD library was chosen because it provides a material design look and feel for the user interface, making it intuitive and easy to use for employees.
The data for the rental transactions will be stored using SQL. SQL is a very strong and versatile database management system. It is perfect for this kind of application because it can handle a lot of data, keep it safe with its security features, and support multiple people using it at the same time. It's really amazing what SQL can do! By using SQL to store the rental information, Fly Skis will have a robust and scalable solution for managing their equipment rentals.
With this proposed solution, Fly Skis will have a centralized, easy-to-use system for tracking equipment rentals, improving the efficiency of the rental process, and reducing frustration among employees.
